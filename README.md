# Phyton-Modules-W6
Modules encapsulate related code into organized, reusable files which can be easily imported into other code.
They allow code reuse by abstracting code into functions, classes, variables etc which can be utilized by other programs.
Some common examples of modules in Python include the math module, random module, os module, numpy module etc. Each contain reusable functions related to their purpose.
Modules can be part of the Python Standard Library which comes pre-installed with Python distributions. Or they can be third-party modules installed separately.
To use a module, the import statement is used, e.g. import math imports the math module allowing usage of its functions.
Modules make Python code more organized and modular by breaking code into self-contained, logical files with related data and functions rather than long, complex programs.
